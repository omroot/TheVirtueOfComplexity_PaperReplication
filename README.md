## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```python
from src import load_data, RandomFourierFeatures, Backtest

features, returns = load_data()
rff = RandomFourierFeatures(gamma=2.0, n_features=6000)
rff_features = rff.transform(features, seed=42)

bt = Backtest(ridge_lambda=1000, train_window=12)
bt.predict(features=rff_features, returns=returns.shift(-1))
print(bt.calc_performance())
```

## Data

**Source data** (`data/`):
| File | Description | Source |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `PredictorData2021 - Monthly.csv` | Welch-Goyal predictors | [Amit Goyal's website](https://sites.google.com/view/agoyal145/) |
| `definitions.xlsx` | Variable definitions | [Amit Goyal's website](https://sites.google.com/view/agoyal145/) |

### Sharpe Ratio by Complexity

## Key Finding

Models with complexity ratio c = P/T >> 1 (more features than observations) achieve superior out-of-sample Sharpe ratios when properly regularized with ridge regression.
